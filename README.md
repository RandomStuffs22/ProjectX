ProjectX: it's simply the theme
===============================

**IMPORTANT**: *Thanks to this GitHub Repo you can track bugfixes and keep your ProjectX copy up to date, but keep in mind that this is a **development version**. Therefore, CSSs and JSs **are not** packed, although you can pack them on your own: I'll update this dev version with bugfixes and icon additions every time you will request any. Also, this ProjectX version **doesn't include the installation wizard** but it contains just the necessary files to make it work properly. If you haven't installed it on your board yet, please download it from the [Mods Site][1] and install it through the installation wizard first.*

> **Current version** beta 0.1-3  
> **Dependencies** jQuery (included in /jscripts folder)  
> **Author** Shade  
> **Special thanks goes to...** Lowseling who created and currently maintains the installation wizard, WebOutfit who reported me a lot of bugs and helped me fixing some of them. They both have access to upcoming releases before anyone else.

General
-------

ProjectX is a MyBB Admin Control Panel theme, which as many people say is the best theme ever made for a MyBB installation. It's clean and revolutionary UI and it's lightweight one-click installation wizard are the main reasons why you should at least try it on your board.

[Here][2] you can enjoy some previews and you can download the actual beta of the full theme + installation wizard.

If you have any feature or icon request, or you want to report any plugin view issue, please let me know opening a new issue on GitHub. Your contribute is very important to me and helps me into making ProjectX more complete on every commit. 

Main features
-------------

At the moment ProjectX is equipped with:

* A lightweight and clean installation wizard which will guide you through ProjectX installation **Not included in GitHub version**
* Stunning and comprehensible graphics
* Clean and intuitive User Interface
* Iconic menu with jQuery-powered tooltip fired on hover, with any language and mobile support
* CSS gorgeous radio buttons with rewritten HTML syntax designed for an intuitive and fast usage
* Great combinations of solid and dashed borders with border-radius support for almost every page in ACP
* Full page navigation for a better board management
* Template full page editing for a better handling and writing
* Support for every browser except for IE =< 8 (untested as for now)

Looking forward to the upcoming release
-----------------------------------

I started the next 0.2 version development with some great ideas in my mind which I will slowly accomplish. Some of them won't be included in the 0.2 release but will be added later on.

> **Inline management** My goal is to bring the simplest user experience to MyBB users while introducing new and stunning features you've never seen. Inline management functionality will completely replace the actual management system. I can't explain it with words: it will be just awesome.  
> **CSS checkboxes** Radio buttons are already CSSed. Checkboxes will be replaced with nicer CSS checkboxes which won't finally differ from a browser to another.  
> **Custom icons** I'm not speaking of menu icons, but the actual /icons icons. They are taken from the default theme and they will certainly be replaced with some custom - and obviously pixel-perfect - icons I'll craft.  
> **Mobile functionality** At the moment you can browse the ACP with a mobile device without particular problems, but it would be nicer if you can browse it with a sort of webapp or at least a mobile interface. I almost started a mobile interface based off modified versions of jQuery Mobile and iScroll frameworks. The goal is to introduce a fully functional webapp, never seen on a MyBB board, but this will take a while, at least half a year of independent developing.
